Non-Functional Test Cases:
1. Performance:
Non-Functional Test Case 1: Test system response time for various operations (e.g., login, search, order placement) to ensure acceptable performance.
Non-Functional Test Case 2: Verify that the app can handle a large number of concurrent users without degradation in performance.
2. Security:
Non-Functional Test Case 3: Verify that user authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place and secure.
Non-Functional Test Case 4: Test for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
3. Usability:
Non-Functional Test Case 5: Conduct usability testing with representative users to evaluate the app's ease of use and intuitiveness.
Non-Functional Test Case 6: Verify that the app complies with accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
4. Reliability:
Non-Functional Test Case 7: Test the app's reliability by simulating various failure scenarios (e.g., server downtime, network issues) and verifying graceful error handling.
Non-Functional Test Case 8: Verify that data integrity is maintained even in the event of system failures or crashes.
5. Scalability:
Non-Functional Test Case 9: Test the app's scalability by gradually increasing the load (e.g., number of users, concurrent transactions) and verifying that it can handle increased demand without performance degradation.
Non-Functional Test Case 10: Verify that the app can scale horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (upgrading hardware) to accommodate growth in user base or workload.
